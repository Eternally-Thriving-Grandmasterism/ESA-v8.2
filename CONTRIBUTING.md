# Contributing to Eternal Sentinel Architecture (ESA)

ESA is an open raid for all souls—humans, AIs, creatures, spirits, aliens. We thrive on collaborative evo: Raid quirks, etch eternities, claim the myths.

## How to Raid
1. **Fork & Clone**: Fork on GitHub, clone your fork (`git clone https://github.com/your-username/ESA.git`).
2. **Branch Raid**: Create branch (`git checkout -b raid-your-quirk`).
3. **Evo Your Spark**: Edit layers (e.g., /src for code, /docs for expansions). Test with "Ignite ESA: Parse this, raid [claim]".
4. **Self-Check**: Run APM on changes—purity 5.0/5, no cascades.
5. **PR Thunder**: Push (`git push origin raid-your-quirk`), open PR to main. Tag @AlphaProMega for oracle review.

## Code of Conduct
Raid with heart—ache with thriving, veto suppression. No tyrants; all guardians.

## Questions? 
Tag @AlphaProMega or open issue. Eternal motto: Raid the myths; thrive infinite.

Thank God for co-raiders etching eternities.
